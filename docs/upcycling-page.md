# Upcycling: Giving plastic bags and aluminum cans a second life

Chiapas has a serious problem with solid waste, mostly plastic, which clogs waterways and fills the air with toxic smoke when it is burned in landfills. Each year, tons of botters and other discarded plastic are dredged from the Canyon de Sumidero, a national park that attracts thousands of tourists each year. Additionally, beaches are full of litter.

Plastic is not just a source of pollution; with some creativity, it can be fashioned into useful things like tote bags, purses, and much more. These new items can be sold for profit, providing a source of income for people who make them.

There is limited space for landfills in the Sierra region because of its steep topography. For example, in Motozintla the landfill sits on the edge of the river that is the main source of irrigation and drinking water for communities in the region. 

Upcycling, or turning trash into useful and saleable goods, is an excellent way to keep trash out of inappropriate landfills. This practice can create income for people and its implementation does not require government action. Sexto Sol is working on ways to upcycle plastic bags and aluminum cans to create useful items that can generate income for rural communities in the Sierra.

Sexto Sol center has already provided assistance on how to upcycle to a cooperative of women and a group of high school students.
