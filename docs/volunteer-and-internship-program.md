## Make a difference in Chiapas and Guatemala

Come join the adventure of applying your hands, heart, and mind to the task of creating economic justice, helping people to grow food sustainably, teaching permaculture, reforesting a mountain, and more.

Part of the Sexto Sol Mission is to provide opportunities for people to do service in the Sierra Madre of Chiapas and in the repatriated refugee communities we assist in Guatemala.

We offer two types of opportunities in the field; volunteer situations and internships. Volunteers are people who come to live and work at Tierra Linda from a week to a couple of months. Our needs change depending on what we are working on at any given time. Check the list of opportunities and contact us to inquire.

We offer a limited number of internship opportunities to people who are interested in developing themselves for future careers in sustainable development through NGO work. Interns make a commitment for longer time. We provide training over this time and opportunities in the field that help interns gain an insight into how NGOs can combat poverty and environmental challenges. Our internship program is open to anyone, although we generally cannot accommodate high school students. 

## Become part of the Sexto Sol Family!

##### General Information

**How to apply:** Please write to tamara@sextosol.org for more information. Send us an introduction including when you'd be available, relevant skills, your level of Spanish, interests, level of education or relevant training and anything else you'd like to mention. It helps for us to know where else you've traveled. Please write VOLUNTEER (all caps) in the subject line. 

We are a small organization so volunteers are an integral part of our success. We do our best to organize projects so that volunteers feel like they are making a difference. We also like to share our knowledge so that volunteers can gain a larger understanding of the region and of the challenges and joys of doing this kind of work.

We do receive more requests to volunteer than we can accommodate. It is easier for us to plan for the next couple of months than far into the future. If you are in Mexico, give us an email to inquire what might be available. We frequently need short term help with the demo farm.

We are pleased to have been invited to partner with Omprakash.org, an service that matches volunteers and organizations. Occasionally they offer travel support to volunteers.

Housing is available at Tierra Linda farm for a modest rent. Volunteers purchase and make their own meals. Tierra Linda is located on the edge of the city of Motozintla in the Sierra Madre region of Chiapas.

Some things we've learned are best mentioned up front: Volunteers with the Sexto Sol Center represent the Field staff, Board of Directors and supporters of our work. We ask that volunteers be certain to have the resources they need to cover their expenses while volunteering. There is no smoking, drinking, or drugs allowed. We also ask all volunteers to be respectful of local people by keeping tidy and making sure to wear appropriate clothing.

## Current Volunteer Opportunities

**Landscaping and gardening:**

Short-term positions to help with landscaping and gardening. If you enjoy working outside and get things done, this is a nice short-term situation. 

**Technology Support:**

Learn how to do the tech things that help non-profits reach out to supporters and also to create teaching tools for use in the field. Facebook, YouTube, Newsletter sending, that kind of thing. Work with us in Chiapas or from your computer at home. Our staff will guide you through tasks so if you are not tech-phobic, it is a great opportunity to learn while helping. 

**Rocket Stoves:**

We need help to heat up very cold schools

**Volunteer opportunities in Guatemala:**

Occasionally we can help you find volunteer situations in Guatemala. Most needed are people with experience in permaculture, organic gardening, appropriate technology or building skills. There may also be situations to help in schools.

**Winter:**

Show your solidarity, come pick coffee in Guatemala at Magnolia Miramar collective coffee farm. This community of repatriated refugees needs help to harvest their coffee each year. Live in the community. Harvest begins in November and continues through February.

**Additional Opportunities:**

There are other ways to help, please contact us for more details. 

## **Volunteer from your home**

Sexto Sol is able to do the work in the field thanks to the help of volunteers who help promote projects, do fundraisers, do research, mail letters, send us books, and much more. In the aftermath of Hurricane Stan, dozens of caring people knited hats for children who lost their homes. We owe much of our success to the participation of volunteers.

Thanks to Dawn Hickerson, MaryAnn Beverly, Tony and Mary Campbell, Luis Manriquez, Greg Willson, Evan Ravitz, Miriam Stein, Amanda Mortl, Jeanmarie Morelli, Melinda Matson, Joe Craven and others who have helped from their homes in the U.S. and Canada.
