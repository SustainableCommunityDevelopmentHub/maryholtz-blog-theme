# Challenges Faced by Small-Scale Coffee Farmers

Click here to learn about our work to assist coffee farmers to better market their coffee.

### Black Gold Poverty

From the rich soils of the steep Sierra Madre Mountains, thousands of _cafetaleros_ harvest the coffee that they sell to sustain their families. The average small-scale farm produces about 20 100-pound bags of coffee each year. For the vast majority of cafetaleros, coffee is their only source of income.

Coffee is a fragile crop that is vulnerable to fluctuations in the weather and that requires a great deal of labor. Three human-caused factors - environmental degradation, the international pricing structure, and the way coffee is bought locally - conspire against cafetalero families who despite their honest labor, remain the perpetual poor of the Sierra Madre.

Commercials created by large coffee-producing corporations depict an idyllic country life for coffee growers. However, growing coffee has always been a gable for poor farmers. The deforestation of Latin America, particularly in Chiapas and Central America, has resulted in diminished rainfall. The lack of abundant water during the critical period when coffee is flowering leads to reduced yields.

### Climate Change

As climate change worsens, erratic weather events will cause further damage to crops.

In both 1998 and 2005, catastrophic flooding from hurricanes caused widespread landslides in deforested lands, which led to the loss of land that had been cultivated in coffee. Specifically, Hurrican stan led to the loss of around 60% of crops in impacted areas(where did she get this from? WE NEED TO CITE). Additionally, at least 40% of the surface area that had been farmed in coffee was lost in landslides(CITATION?). In an already improvised region, people may well never overcome such massive losses.

### Local Trade & Cycle of Debt

The production of coffee is very costly due to its labor-intensiveness. With bank loan rates at 20% interest or more, growers typically obtain loans from middlemen to finance the production of coffee. These middlemen, called coyotes, oftentimes oblige the indebted grower to give part of the harvest in payment. Coffee growers typically sell the rest to the middlemen at low prices, who then sell the coffee to exporting companies. As a result of this system, coyotes are typically the only ones who make money from coffee.

While the problem of middlemen is troublesome the real structural problem in the coffee industry is the way coffee prices are set internationally. Futures traders making their fortunes in commodities trading on the New York Exchange seem as remote from the realities of life in the Sierra as the capricious Gods on Zion deciding the fate of the humans. Farmers cannot predict the profit they will gain from each harvest since the vagaries of the international pricing structure are unpredictable; bringing misfortune overnight regardless of the amount of labor given to a harvest.

\*If previously growing coffee has always been a risk, now that the bottom has fallen out of world coffee prices, for poor farmers growing coffee has become a serious liability. **{__ This is a bit confusing; I need an explanation on what Tamara meant**}**

### International Pricing Structure & The Coffee Crisis

**{what is the purpose of adding "from our archives" in titles/ could we erase it/is there a specific page where viewers can access the arhives/ could you define archives for me in the context of Sexto Sol?}**

An estimated 20 million people in 50 countries around the world depend on growing coffee for their livelihood.

Since coffee is a commodity, its value at a given point in the year is determined by the total volume produced worldwide. When volume exceeds consumption, prices plummet. Though Vietnam only recently began to produce coffee it has become the second largest producer after Brazil. In 2001, the unprecedented introduction of this high volume of coffee from Vietnam dramatically depressed world prices. The impact has been absolutely devastating for other coffee-producing countries around the world.

A farmer’s cost for producing a 100 pound bag of un-milled coffee averages between $70-90 in Chiapas. When local prices were around $55 in 2001, farmers knew they could not afford the cost of paying the seasonal pickers from Guatemala to harvest their crop. Many desperately tried to convince the pickers work for an even split. Despite relying on seasonal income, Guatemalan pickers were unwilling to work for such little pay.

When prices fell to half the cost of production in 2002, farmers, both large and small, simply did not pick their crop. Coffee rotted on the trees while frowers found themselves in debt and without an income.

Government subsidies with the purpose of preventing a serious shortage of food have not materialized because census workers have not documented the location of thousands of farmers throughout the topography of the Sierra. As economic hardships continue to increase in the region, many analysts predict that there may be a surge of violence. A probable increase in crime is imminent as desperate people turn to robbery to survive.

**{when was this written? how can we change the wording so that it reflects contemporary events? when were those predictions made? Were the predictions proved right/wrong?}**

The economic hardships in the Sierra Madre's economy had a ripple effect on neighboring Guatemala. Poor Guatemalan corn farmers depend on the chance to work in Chiapas during the dry season while their fields are fallow. It is a case where the desperately poor work the chronically poor.

Sexto Sol hosted many dejected Guatemalans at Tierra Linda School in 2001 who had been unable to find work and were returning on foot to their homes 150 miles away without food or water. In 2002, the Guatemalans were conspicuously absent. News stories reported that authorities in Guatemala were bracing for a high level of child mortality from starvation - a tragedy directly attributed to the loss of work in coffee farms. This is the invisible reality of commerce in coffee in the current context.

### Interconnectedness

Ethiopia and Burundi are countries that derive a major portion of their national income from coffee. With a lot of people around the world depending on coffee, especially those countries without the means to provide for them, we are facing a humanitarian crisis.

The coffee crisis and its exacerbation of poverty in low-income countries is an opportunity for people to learn how connected we are to each other. {how}

Increases in civil strife in poor countries should be viewed in terms of the loss of income in those countries, which are created by the distortions of local economies by international trade and microfinance {Increases in civil strife in poor countries should be viewed in terms of the loss of the means of making a living for large sectors of those countries from distortions created in local economies by international trade and macro finance. - **This paragraph is not very clear. Did you mean to convey something similar to what I rewrote?**}

We encourage everyone to look at the larger context of events when analyzing world news. {she's trying to call people into action - I would add a transition between this and the last paragraph} Do not tolerate repression of marginalized individuals by governments that only seek to enforce corrupt economic schemes. Instead, envision and advocate for the establishment of a more stable world economy {by doing what? How can people advocate and help establish a more stable world economy? } that puts human rights at the forefront. Human rights and the will of the people must always be respected. {Let the failed economic scheme wither away. It is time now. - **is there a way you could rephrase this?**}

{**Transition**}

The unfortunate suggestion to Vietnam that coffee would solve the country's lack of development led to an unbalance in the trade of coffee, which caused millions of coffee farmers to lose their profits. In a Denver Post article, Ted Lingle, resident of the Specialty Coffee Association of America, suggested to the Commodities Exchange that "triage," or trash coffee, should not be counted in the world volume of coffee. {**why is it important for triage to not be included in the world volume of coffee? Where can we find this article to clarify the statement?**}

According to an Oxfam report, 20 million people make their living from growing coffee worldwide. Coffee is usually grown in countries without the economic stability needed to provide alternative employment for disenfranchised coffee producers. {**Why is it important that coffee is usually grown in countries without the economic stability needed to provide alternative employment for people?**}

The world is accustomed to responding with humanitarian aid when natural disasters hit developing{**revise the term?**} countries. However, in the case of the coffee crisis {**How does the world respond to the coffee crisis?, then move on to describing the ideal way in which the world should react**}. Ideally, governments would take preventative measures to avert serious humanitarian problems that impact commodity crop farmers. These solutions should be based on insight into the real-life challenges coffee producers face, especially **smallholders {What does smallholders mean? how would you like adding another page with a lof of definitions so that people know what we are talking about? We could also just do the thing where you hover over a word and it tells you the definition}**.

Development professionals should take a sobering lesson from the disaster caused by Vietnam's coffee production as the government tried to solve their developmental problems. 

Because of our interconnected world and markets, we must view projects{**what type of projects**} within the larger world context. At the same time, we hope that with the crisis those who view commodity agriculture only in terms of investment will give importance to the human costs of the manipulation of market forces, such as coffee supply, in the future. Fomenting local instability in regions already over-burned by debt through the manipulation of market forces is not in anyone's interest.

#### Consequences of Farmers Converting to Other Crops {could I change?}

**Environment** – Coffee is usually grown under a canopy of native shade trees. This cover provides a habitat for migratory birds and functions to protect the watershed from soil erosion. When coffee farmers begin to produce peanut or corn, as people in the Sierra Madre say they will, the trees will be cut down {**Are there any new developments - did the people in SM actually converted to other crops/what were the impacts of it?**}. The consequences for the ecology of tropical regions will be severe.

{**Transition**} The fact that coffee has been left unharvested {**who stopped harvesting the coffee and for which reasons**} has increased the risk of pest infestation, making it difficult to farm organically as pesticides are needed to control pests. According to the Organic Coffee Association’s list of the “Dirty Dozen” chemicals used on coffee farms, several of the most commonly used poisons are highly toxic to birds.

**Implications for the Availability of Quality Coffee from Unique Origins:** A lot of factors affect the quality of coffee at the level of the farm. These include soils, climate, altitude, sun, and the care with which this labor-intensive crop is handled throughout the year. Coffee grown at higher altitudes has better characteristics. Both Brazil and Vietnam, the two largest producers of coffee, produce coffee at low altitudes, with Brazilian farms producing without shade trees{**how does the no shade farms relate directly to altitude?**}. These are not considered good coffees. We are at great risk of losing farms with more favorable conditions for producing unique coffees in the rest of the coffee-producing countries around the world {**are we at risk because more farmers are starting to transition to other crops?**}. It takes five years for a new plant to begin to produce so it is doubtful that farmers would resume coffee production if prices were to improve. {**are there new developments?**}

##### Migration Pressures Will Increase

The survival of a very large percentage of families in the Sierra Madre already depends on sending relatives thousands of miles away to try their luck at crossing illegally into the U.S. to find work. These families often express "No me queda otro camino sino irme al norte," meaning that they have no other way but to go to the United States.

Situated near the Guatemalan borders in Chiapas, Sexto Sol constantly comes into contact with young men from Central American countries whose families similarly hope that they will arrive to the U.S. Like in the Sierra Madre, many have not overcome the losses caused by Hurricane Mitch in 1998. Imagine what it would be like at age 19 to take only a bit of cash that relatives have put together and to travel through several unknown countries, chased all the time by immigration officers, just to get to the line demarking the promised land.

#### Definition of Sustainable Trade From the Institute for Environment and Development

Sustainable trade takes place when the international exchange of goods and services yields positive social, economic and environmental benefits, reflecting the four core criteria of sustainable development:

1. it generates economic value...
2. it reduces poverty and inequality...
3. it regenerates the environmental resource base, and...
4. it is carried out within an open and accountable system of governance

### The following article appeared in the Sept/ Oct. Issues of the Chronicle of the Specialty Coffee Association of America

### Small Scale Coffee Growers Reach Toward Self Sufficiency in the Sierra Madre of Chiapas, México

There is much talk these days about sustainable coffee as coffee buyers and consumers have become more aware of the environmental impact of coffee production in the developing world. But for coffee to be truly sustainable, the welfare of the small-scale farming families who produce the coffee must form part of the equation along with migratory birds, the elimination of chemicals and concerns about water quality.

In the Mexican State of Chiapas, the Sierra Madre Mountains rise sharply from the coastal plains formed by 46 rivers. The warm air cools as it rises up the slopes from the steamy rainforests of the lower elevations and turns to mist in the high coffee farms. It is a vast region where thousands of small-scale coffee farmers work their shaded lands with the desire each year that the harvest will finally provide enough to adequately sustain their families. But so far, it never quite does.

The Sierra Madre has eight municipalities and scores of tiny hamlets of subsistence farmers clinging to steep slopes that were deforested years ago by commercial logging and now are a patchwork of cornfields. It remains the poorest region in a state that has seen indigenous communities hundreds of miles to the north take up arms in frustration at their impoverished conditions. Despite the fact that the small-scale coffee producers of the Sierra Madre bring tons of high altitude Arabica coffee to market each year, the poverty of this region is stubbornly entrenched.

The cause is simple. Lacking capital to fund the costs of harvesting and processing their coffee, small-scale producers find no alternative than to reluctantly accept loans from middlemen called “coyotes”. The indebtedness obliges them to sell to the coyote for a price set among their peers who allow themselves a nice profit margin based on New York pricing. Responsible to laborers from nearby Guatemala, who must be fed while they wait to be paid, the farmers feel the pressure to sell immediately upon harvest.

Under this system known throughout Latin America as “coyotismo”, there is no incentive to control quality. Everyone knows that the coyotes routinely mix in inferior coffee with the good so as to pass on volumes to the transnational corporations that market to Europe and the U.S. Quality is not rewarded with a fitting price. Therefore it does not become cost-effective to order the pickers to leave greens on the branch for a second and third harvest. As one grower explained, “Unlike in the past when we picked carefully, now they take it all in one sweep. With what we can afford to pay, it has deteriorated to this.”

Government development programs aimed at assisting the farmers to improve their harvests effectively end up benefiting the coyotes. “What is missing from the scheme is the most important piece -- adequate information and assistance in marketing their coffee independently from the middlemen,” says Francisco Barrios, who organizes small-scale producers so that they can export. But organizing these growers is a challenging task. Many have had bad experiences with so-called democratic organizations over the years; some Fair Trade labeled. Barrios explains, “They have been lied to and given false promises only to see the leaders of the organizations grow conspicuously rich while they remain in the same precarious conditions as always.”

Francisco Barrios, who was born in the Sierra Madre and as a young man rode his motorcycle into the farthest reaches of the mountains, has known many coffee farmers since his childhood when they would come out of the mountains to buy supplies in his family’s general store in Motozintla. Reflecting on the difficulties of his beleaguered state of Chiapas he came to the conclusion that through organized marketing in sufficient volumes of quality coffee, the farmers could obtain a fair price.

But his vision does not stop there. Coffee is a fragile crop as we saw last year when drought, fires which spread from the yearly practice of burning cornfields, and finally three devastating hurricanes destroyed over 80% of the harvest. Added to this disaster was the blow of some of the lowest prices in recent memory. For this reason, Barrios promotes the creation of a fund from the coffee exported by small grower-organizations which will then seed other businesses eventually providing the self-sufficiency needed to eliminate the need for loans to finance the harvest. “In the Sierra there is a sleeping potential in the women who now spend all their time slaving away at tedious domestic tasks. When they have their own businesses they will have the freedom to contribute to the family economy. Then they can finally be free of the coyotes.”

#### Francisco Barrios with Sierra Oro Co-op Directors

This is precisely what the newly formed organization of 26 families Cerro de la Olla is attempting to do. With the help of the Sexto Sol Center for Community Action, a U.S. non-profit of which Barrios is co-founder, the women are seeking seed money to allow them to build a poultry business. Forget the notion of “small-scale” here, their goal is to raise 10,000 chickens. Thus liberated from the urgency to sell to coyotes for much need cash at the moment of the harvest, the growers can store their coffee for export.

The women are thrilled at the idea of delving into the new adventure of becoming businesswomen and all the challenges and joys that will bring them. “Together we will face whatever difficulties,” one woman said. This is impressive in a culture where the admitted obstacles to collective action envidia, a destructive form of jealously, and individualismo, the propensity to isolation, often destroy social organizations. These families are aware that they are pioneers in this new strategy to achieve self-sufficiency. But with the harvest coming in only a few short months, the families are hard-pressed to find the means to establish their business so that they can be free to export.

Convinced of the economic advantage of direct marketing their coffee, they are committed to producing quality coffee in an environmentally responsible way. Once the start-up capital is found and the business is producing, funds will be used to meet the heavy expense of technical training in how to prepare their cafetales for future organic certification. They are hopeful that the unique qualities of their coffee will command a price independent of the vagaries of New York, which, from their vantage point, has nothing to do with the realities of life in the mountains where ruins still preserve the ancient pottery and jade carvings of their Maya ancestors. With the small-scale growers directing the marketing of their ecologically produced coffee, supported by diverse collective enterprises, they will finally achieve a truly sustainable production and will do so with dignity.
